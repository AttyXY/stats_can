Welcome to stats_can's documentation!
=====================================


Docs are quite rudimentary right now. I've figured out how to get sphinx to dump my docstrings into this page and make them look semi legible, but that's it so far. Stay tuned.

Indices and tables
==================

* :ref:`genindex`
* :ref:`modindex`
* :ref:`search`
