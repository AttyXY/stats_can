# Python api for Statistics Canada New Data Model (NDM)

API documentation for StatsCan can be found here: https://www.statcan.gc.ca/eng/developers/wds

If you're looking for Table/Vector IDs to use in the app you can find them through this:
https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/en/type/data

Anaconda package here: 
https://anaconda.org/ian.e.preston/stats_can


I'll slowly be building this up, mostly to meet my personal needs (hence English only for now)
Right now it's functional for pulling table data into a dictionary, downloading a list of tables to a folder, checking all downloaded tables in a folder for updates, and updating if appropriate, and reading a table into a pandas DataFrame

This is my first git repo, I think if you have anaconda the link above should make installing easy, but if anything is messed up please let me know.
